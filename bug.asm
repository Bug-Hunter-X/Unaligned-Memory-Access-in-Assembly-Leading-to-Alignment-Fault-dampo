mov eax, [ebx + ecx*4 + 0x10]

This line of assembly code attempts to access memory at an address calculated as the sum of the value in EBX, four times the value in ECX, and 0x10.  The issue arises if the resulting address is not properly aligned.  If the address isn't a multiple of four (for a 32-bit integer), this instruction will result in an alignment fault or segmentation fault, causing the program to crash.

The problem is subtle because it only manifests under specific conditions depending on the values of EBX and ECX.  It's easily missed if the values aren't carefully examined during debugging, and simply stepping through the code might not reveal the root cause immediately.
